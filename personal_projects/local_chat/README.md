# LOCAL CHAT
## A system for local in game chat to facilitate roleplay.

### Installation
Place the following scripts in your scripts folder and reload:
    * v(1/2)/local_chat.dsc
    * utilities [folder]

### Usage
Simply chat in game! The two versions of LOCAL CHAT function similiarly, with one major difference; version 1.x.x has a hard cutoff point, and version 2.x.x removes characters over a distance. This means v1 is easier to understand, and easier to get started using, but has less flexibility, where as v2 can take a bit of elbow grease to get working the way you would want on your server. That being said, both of these scripts come with a set of defaults from the author (that's me!) and so you can always defer to that and simply use as is. Feel free to check the readme for more information for either version.

#### Note
The file local_chat.dsc is named the same for v1 and for v2 because they are *not* compatible with each other. They both do the same thing in different ways, so it doesn't make sense to try to have both, but it's worth pointing out. Pick one version or the other :D
