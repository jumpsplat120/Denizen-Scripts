### Installation
Place the following scripts in your scripts folder:
   * /core
   * config.dsc

Add the textures to your server resource pack.

### Usage
Craft a note by placing paper in the middle slot, and any colors you'd like in the top three
or bottom three slots. Colors that go in the top three slots will change the ink, while
colors in the bottom slot will change the paper color. You can place an unwritten note to continue
adding/removing/changing colors. Once you have your desired colors, right click the note to begin
writing.

There is also a `/note` command which allows you to configure more than just the colors of the
note. Check `/help note` for more information.
