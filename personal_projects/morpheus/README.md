# MORPHEUS
## A democratic sleep system

### Installation
Place the following scripts in your scripts folder and reload:
   * morpheus.dsc

### Usage
Go to sleep! When a percentage of the player population (percentage defined in the config contained within the script) is matched or exceeded, the time will pass! You no longer need the entire server to sleep at the same time for the night to pass.
