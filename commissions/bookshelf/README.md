### Installation
Just put the script in your scripts folder and reload.

### Usage
Left click on a bookshelf with a written book to place it on the shelf, or
to check out a transient copy of the book, if one already exists on the
shelf.

Right click on a bookshelf to view the author and title of a book.

Shift left click on a bookshelf to remove the book placed there, if you
were the one who put it there. While only the original player can remove
the book via shift left clicking, the book will drop automatically
if the bookshelf is burned down or exploded.
