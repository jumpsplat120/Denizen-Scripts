### Installation
Place the following scripts in your scripts folder and reload:
   * /core
   * config.dsc
   * /utilities

Place the textures on your server, or if just testing, locally on your own client. Reload the textures.

### Usage
Craft any of the instruments (check `/core/custom_items.dsc` for crafting recipes), the right click the instrument to play a note. Looking up will play higher notes, while looking down will play lower notes. Left click to change the root note of the scale, and shift left click to change the scale.

Shift right click to turn on advanced mode. When in advanced mode, the range for needing to look up/down is shrunk by 50%. This makes it harder to hit individual notes, but will allow you to play notes faster, since you don't need to move your mouse as far for each note.
