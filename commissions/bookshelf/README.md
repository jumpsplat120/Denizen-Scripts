### Installation
Place the following scripts in your scripts folder and reload:
   * bookshelf.dsc

### Usage
Left click on a bookshelf with a written book to place it on the shelf, or to check out a transient copy of the book, if one already exists on the shelf.

Right click on a bookshelf to view the author and title of a book.

Shift left click on a bookshelf to remove the book placed there, if you were the one who put it there. While only the original player can remove the book via shift left clicking, the book will drop automatically if the bookshelf is burned down or exploded.
